2. Product advantages: Users teach to get paid. Users learn directly one-on-one. Community learning is free and anyone can contribute moments and create lessons.  

3. Over deliver: There is no centralized vetting of teachers, so net pay is greater and lessons are cheaper. Lots of free community-generated materials, ranked and searchable, helps teachers promote themselves while providing resources for learners.
