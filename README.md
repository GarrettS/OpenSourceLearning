# Open Source Learning


## Overview 
Mentorship platform for teachers and learners where everyone is a student and anyone can be a teacher. Cryptocurrency enabled. Live video and video exchange. Community-driven.

## Problems: 
Users don't have access to tutors. Current options include static resources like YouTube and Stack exchange, and tutor websites like Wyzant, Lessons.com, and Thumbtack.

Teachers don't have a platform to teach on. 

**YouTube:** Users can't ask the video a question. Payment model is through ad revenue or third party processors (Patreon, etc).

* Incohesive, disconnected experience. Learners need to 1) find teachers, 2) Arrange for payment (Through the app, Patreon, Paypal, etc), and 3) Do the lesson (email, skype). 

**StackExchange:** Contributors paid in "points". That's nice but people need money. 

**Tutoring Websites:**

* Teachers burdened by a lengthy vetting ordeal. This process costs the company money and that impacts teachers' profit which ranges 60-80%, before tax. We can deliver better service with dispute resolution at a nominal 4% fee, resulting in a teacher takeaway of 96%. 

* Teachers perfectly capable of teaching their subject of mastery are unqualified due to reasons like "no degree". The qualification process costs the teacher and the platform several hours.

* Authoritarian governance. Impartial governance is necessary to handle dispute resolution and to ensure fair treatment of all: teachers and learners.

* Incohesive, disconnected experience. Learners need to 1) find teachers, 2) Do the lesson (email, skype). 

**College:** Inconvenient. Wasteful of time and money.
